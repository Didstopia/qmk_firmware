## FIXME: Since we want to build from this local
##        repository, we have to figure out how to do that
##        as well as document the steps here,
##        perhaps even add a small build script?

# Install QMK tap
tap 'qmk/qmk'

# Install QMK
# NOTE: Run "qmk setup" after installing!
brew 'qmk'

# Install extra casks/drivers tap
tap 'homebrew/cask-drivers'

# Install QMK Toolbox app to "~/Applications/QMK Toolbox.app"
cask 'qmk-toolbox'
